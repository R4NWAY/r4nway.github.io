              It is not a secret. Olympic athletes, top executives, famous actors, singers, presenters you see in media every day
              use these methods. To deal with their struggles, to increase focus and motivation, to reprogram their mind, body
              and heart, to achieve even more extraordinary results.
            </p>

            <p>We sometimes only see the body of an athlete, the mind of successful entrepreneur, the charisma of talented
              actor. We miss the fact that in order to be at their best, they need to reach a state of unity of body, mind and
              spirit. Laser focused and relaxed (you can’t play well when you are tight), incredibly present, effective and
              efficient, yet almost lost in time, concentrated yet open minded, acting on autopilot but sharp and nimble, taking
              the right decisions quickly to adjust to the situation.</p>

            <p>
              We are all cut from the same cloth. Our thoughts, emotions, and body are all interconnected. When we
              experience emotional distress it often manifests in our bodies with headaches, muscle pain and tension,
              dizziness, nausea, weight shifts, upset stomach. If not addressed in the right way, it might cause physical illness
              and destabilize our life in many different areas.</p>

            <p>
              Rapid Transformational Therapy® does wonders. It gives peace, focus, strength, the sense of wholeness,
              completeness, and harmony you need to be at your best.</p>

            <p>
              To break the world record. To deal with trauma. To live the life you want.
            </p>

            <p>It simply works.</p>
            <p>Now it is available to you.</p>

          <div class="nk-title-sep"></div>
          <p>

            Theta brain waves, measured at 4-7 Hz, are frequencies that human brain exhibit during the barely conscious states of
            REM sleep, but also when we are awake and meditate, in deep relaxation, hypnotic trans, and when we’re drifting off to
            sleep or just before we fully awake. It is a very natural state. The state when our analytical, rational, judging mind is off,
            when our inner critic is turned off. Theta waves are important for processing information, implicit learning (learning a
            complex task acquired largely without conscious control, like learning language pattern or learning to ride a bike) and
            memory formation. They are the intriguing border between the conscious and the subconscious worlds.
            <p />
            <p>
              The subconscious never rests, and it has the answers to many problems that happen to us on a conscious level. In fact,
              many of the world’s most successful people intentionally direct the workings of their subconscious mind while they are
              sleeping or meditating. That is how Albert Einstein worked through his revolutionary breakthroughs. That is what
              Richard Branson uses to solve challenges of his over 400 businesses. That is how Dalajlama finds paths to enlightenment.
            </p>

            <p>
              While in a theta state, the mind is capable of deep and profound learning, healing and growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hypnosis enables us to reach the state of theta brain wave pattern. That allows us to unlock and access memories crucial
              to understand the root cause of our struggle, also these suppressed or long time forgotten. It is often incredibly
              surprising how subtle small details of an event people can recall in hypnosis, often events when they were just few years
              old and they never thought of before. The therapist helps the client resolve these issues, revealed unconscious thoughts,
              memories, or conflicts to help the person utilize these insights in constructive and beneficial ways. In this state we can
              more effectively influence the powerful subconscious part of ourselves that is normally inaccessible to our waking
              minds.

          <div class="nk-title h3">How rewiring your mind works</div>
          <div class="nk-title-sep"></div>

          <p>


            It is fascinating how our brains can change. Neuroscientists discovered that we could make permanent, significant
            changes to our brain structure (neurogenesis) and function (neuroplasticity) and create new behaviors and
            reactions by rewiring the brain.
          </p>


          <p>
            Every thought, feeling or action fires up specific neurons in our brain. Electric impulses always follow the path of
            least resistance (the fastest pathway). When we introduce new ideas, feelings, behaviors the new neural pathway
            is created. With the repetition, especially in hypnosis when our internal critic doesn’t interfere, brain cells in this
            new circuit communicate frequently, the connection between them strengthens and the impulses on this neural
            pathway travel faster and faster. Axons (nerve fibres, that carry nerve impulses) of these nerve cells are getting
            coated with a layer of myelin (fatty & protein substance). It insulates neurons and allows electrical impulses to
            transmit quickly and efficiently along the nerve cells.

          </p>

          <p>
            At the same time, as you repeat new thoughts and behaviors strengthening new pathways, you naturally weaken
            old neural connections that your old harmful thoughts and habits used to travel though. You move away from the
            status quo and overcome past traumatic events that evoke anxiety and stress. Soon you realize when you are in
            heat of the moment, thoughts “What’s wrong with me?” or “I can’t stand it anymore!” do not even cross your
            mind. They are simply not the fastest pathway in your brain anymore!
          </p>

          <p>

            Eventually, through repetition in hypnotic state and feeling intensity, your new habits run on autopilot. Your new
            thoughts and habits effortlessly become part of your identity & transform your life. Nothing holds you back from
            living your life to the fullest now.
