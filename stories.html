                    <em>"Dear Lucy, <br />
                      the session you did with me four weeks ago was incredibly liberating, healing, and
                      powerful. I feel as if you took off a heavy load from my shoulders. I was in therapy for months before,
                      and I was aware of my past experiences, but I did not expect one could address these memories the
                      way and with the power you did. Immediately after the session and the day after, I felt light, relaxed,
                      calm beyond belief — a haven of peace.
                      For four weeks, I have been listening to the audio you prepared for me, and for a week, I walk
                      through my apartment at night without any fear. I walk through each room without turning on all
                      the lights. I don’t shake like a terrified rabbit. I don’t look behind with my heart in my mouth as I used
                      to. It is unbelievable! For a week, I feel entirely free from the fear of being in the darkness. I haven’t
                      had this feeling since 15, maybe even 20 years!
                      Almost one year of psychotherapy hasn’t managed to calm down my fear and anxiety to the level of
                      normal functioning, and you did it in 3 weeks, starting with just one 2-hour session. No fear, no
                      anxiety, no panic attacks. It’s truly amazing!
                      Lucy, you helped me find the tranquility I needed so much. I am immensely grateful.
                      Thank you!"</em>

                      "Lucy, I want to thank you for what you have done for me. Our session was very emotional for me and
                      difficult with all the heavily loaded memories that came back. It took almost two days for my body to
                      let go (the pressure in my heart to calm down and tension in my stomach); however, I felt at peace
                      from the moment we talked. And this peace has been growing and growing since then.
                      I had been regularly seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist for a few months and I can tell you: your
                      session was so much more complex, much more intense, and so much more powerful. Straight to the
                      point, which I have never thought about before… Now I do understand where my fears came from.
                      Lucy, my heart rate is regular without medication for the first time in 2 months! And I have not had a
                      panic attack so far, which was an everyday thing for me.
                      I continue to listen to your lovely recording, as it makes a huge difference. I am grateful to have had
                      this session with you.
                      Big thank you!"

                      keep my temper under control easily, and I do not get easily teased by other people's comments or behaviors. I still cannot believe that I am leaving it behind so quickly and without much effort after so many years of anger
                      management problems. Thank you, Lucyna. I admit I was quite skeptical when I was advised to speak with you. Now I am grateful I was referred to you. Instead of trying to control everybody around, I am regaining control over my

                    <em>"Dear Lucyna, <br />
                      I can’t thank you enough. I have been living with various medical and psychological
                      diagnoses almost my entire life. Despite multiple medications and therapy cycles, I felt I was left
                      alone with my fears, deficits, and imperfections. I was trying to live the best I could, but I didn’t enjoy
                      my life. Smiling and empathetic outside completely crashed &amp; destroyed inside. Without identity, I
                      hated the world while loving it, full of conflicting emotions &amp; turmoil of thoughts. I didn’t cope with
                      my life and felt guilty all the time. I felt guilty for others’ bad moods, I felt hopeless, and I tried
                      desperately to hold onto what was destroying me.<br />
                      I feel amazing. Since our session 10 days ago, fears and anxiety have not appeared even once.
                      Moreover, I can laugh with the entire me, even feeling butterflies in my stomach. Hardly anything
                      irritates me. To say, “I feel reborn”, is almost an understatement.<br />
                      I say “no” when I do not want something more often, and it comes naturally without feeling guilty at
                      all. I keep listening to your recording a few times a day, and I dare to say that never in my entire life I
                      felt so peaceful as I do now. It is addicting. <br />
                      It is not only I feel this way, but others notice my transformation as well. The friend who
                      recommended you to me and my partner have noticed I am way more relaxed and at ease recently.
                      Thank you for your wonderful heart and your soothing voice. Thanks to you, I am regaining my smile
                      again and regaining my life.<br />
                      You have shown me how to nurture my inner power with my sense of safety and deep acceptance
                      that I do deserve good. I do not bend down anymore. It turned out I am not a defect, I am not a flaw,
                      I am not a fault.<br />
                      I am forever grateful for what you have done for me. I am reborn again.<br />
                      You are an angel."</em>

                      before even trying as before. She also seems not to be embarrassed that much when she cannot do things right from the first time and decides whether she wants to continue or not. Previously she continued a new “hobby” (like
                      dancing or playing an instrument) without enjoying it just because she felt guilty to quit. Very promising first
                      steps! There is nothing more heartbreaking for a mother to see that her child struggles and you don’t know how to help her, and there is nothing more heart-warming for a mother than to see her child growing and overcoming her
                      limitations. Thank you!"</em>

                      where my self-doubts, self-criticism, lack of self-worth, and confidence came from. Why I kept telling
                      myself, “I must be perfect” and “I’m stupid” a hundred times a day. I would have never guessed
                      before which of my experiences made me this way, and now it seems so clear and so obvious. It is
                      almost unbelievable I have never realized it before. But more importantly, I feel the change is already
                      happening in me. When I am outside, I look people in the eyes; I even sometimes smile, not with
                      embarrassment but towards others. I do not avoid people, and I don’t try to be invisible.<br />
                      I have always thought I am just extremely shy, weird, and not social at all. You showed me I am not.
                      You showed me why I developed these thoughts and behaviors, and you are helping me go over them
                      with this beautiful, empowering recording. I can’t thank you enough."</em>

                      Thank you for helping me find my own strength and hope. I felt helpless my whole life. I used to think,
                      “I am good at what I do, and I can achieve what I want” on one day, just to come back to feeling
                      helpless and hopeless the day after. Thanks to you, I understood that rejections I have experienced so
                      many times as a child made me believe that nothing I need and want is available to me, that women
                      should be silent and have no right to speak, that women are destined to be victims… So I was
                      sabotaging myself to avoid disappointment and pain. Yet, it caused me to suffer from
                      disappointment and pain – exactly what I wanted to avoid.<br />
                      Now I feel free :), I feel full of power, I believe I can, and I will achieve what I have been dreaming of for 36 years. I know I can. I am not a silent woman anymore. I speak up, not only through the music I play. I am playing
                      the symphony of my life now. Please keep doing the wonders that you do!"
